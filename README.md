# MLOps Pipeline with Prefect Orchestration and MLflow Tracking

This repository implements a comprehensive MLOps solution that demonstrates production-ready machine learning pipeline orchestration using Prefect and experiment tracking with MLflow. The system automatically processes NYC taxi data to train a regression model while capturing complete experimental metadata and homework validation metrics.

## System Architecture

### Core Design Philosophy

The implementation employs Prefect's modern `serve()` deployment pattern, representing an evolution from traditional work pool architectures toward self-contained, automatically-deploying pipeline systems. This approach eliminates manual deployment steps and complex infrastructure coordination by creating services that become immediately operational upon container initialization.

### Component Overview

**Orchestration Layer**: Prefect 3.x manages workflow execution, dependency resolution, task scheduling, and failure recovery through an integrated server and flow serving architecture.

**Experiment Tracking**: MLflow provides comprehensive experiment lifecycle management, including parameter logging, metric tracking, model versioning, and artifact storage with PostgreSQL backend persistence.

**Data Layer**: PostgreSQL serves as the unified metadata store for both Prefect workflow state and MLflow experimental data, ensuring consistency and enabling complex queries across the entire system.

**Containerization**: Docker provides isolated, reproducible execution environments with strategic volume mounting for data persistence and cross-container communication through dedicated networking.

**Self-Documentation**: The pipeline automatically captures and presents all required homework metrics during execution, demonstrating how production systems can integrate validation and compliance reporting directly into operational workflows.

## Quick Start Guide

### Infrastructure Initialization

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command establishes the full system stack including database initialization, service discovery, and automatic flow deployment. The architecture self-configures without requiring additional setup procedures.

### Interface Access Points

- **Prefect Dashboard**: http://localhost:4200 (Workflow orchestration and monitoring)
- **MLflow Console**: http://localhost:5000 (Experiment tracking and model management)

### Deployment Verification

Navigate to the Prefect interface and examine the Deployments section. The system automatically exposes three operational endpoints:

- `homework-complete-solution`: Comprehensive pipeline with integrated answer capture
- `data-download`: Modular data acquisition component
- `model-inspection`: Model analysis and validation utilities

The absence of manual deployment steps demonstrates the self-bootstrapping capability inherent in modern containerized MLOps architectures.

## Understanding the Serve-Based Architecture

### Architectural Evolution Context

Traditional Prefect deployments require explicit work pool creation, worker process management, and separate deployment script execution. This implementation instead leverages the `serve()` pattern, which consolidates deployment configuration and execution management into a unified, long-running service.

This architectural decision reflects several important principles in modern distributed systems design. Self-contained services reduce operational complexity by eliminating coordination requirements between separate deployment and execution phases. The approach also improves resource utilization by avoiding idle worker processes waiting for work assignment.

### Service Integration Patterns

The system demonstrates sophisticated microservices communication where each container provides specialized capabilities while maintaining clear interface boundaries. The Prefect server offers workflow management APIs, MLflow provides experiment tracking services, and the flow server executes actual pipeline logic while orchestrating communication with both external services.

This pattern teaches essential lessons about building systems that scale beyond single-machine constraints while maintaining operational simplicity during development and testing phases.

## Pipeline Execution Procedures

### Primary Workflow Execution

1. Access the Prefect interface at the designated URL
2. Navigate to the Deployments section
3. Locate the `homework-complete-solution` deployment
4. Initiate execution through the Quick Run interface
5. Monitor progress through the Flow Runs dashboard

The pipeline automatically processes the complete March 2023 Yellow taxi dataset, applies feature engineering transformations, trains a LinearRegression model with proper MLflow integration, and captures all required homework validation metrics during execution.

### Component-Level Analysis

Individual pipeline components can be executed separately to understand specific functionality patterns. The `data-download` deployment demonstrates data acquisition and caching strategies, while the `model-inspection` deployment illustrates MLflow model introspection techniques.

### Execution Monitoring

The Prefect interface provides comprehensive observability into pipeline execution including task-level progress tracking, dependency visualization, detailed logging output, and error diagnosis capabilities. Each flow run generates complete audit trails suitable for compliance and debugging purposes.

## Automated Answer Capture System

### Validation Methodology

The pipeline incorporates automatic homework answer extraction directly into the workflow logic, eliminating manual calculation requirements and reducing human error potential. This approach demonstrates how production systems can integrate validation and compliance checking into operational procedures.

### Expected Validation Results

**Question 1 - Orchestration Tool**: The system identifies Prefect as the workflow orchestration platform.

**Question 2 - Version Information**: Pipeline execution logs confirm Prefect version 3.4.5 deployment.

**Question 3 - Initial Dataset Size**: Data loading operations report 3,403,766 records from the March 2023 Yellow taxi dataset.

**Question 4 - Processed Dataset Size**: Feature engineering and outlier filtering operations result in 3,316,216 records for model training.

**Question 5 - Model Intercept**: LinearRegression training produces an intercept value of approximately 24.77.

**Question 6 - Model Artifact Size**: The serialized model artifact measures approximately 4,534 bytes, reflecting the storage requirements for 518 learned coefficients plus associated metadata.

### Answer Verification Procedures

Pipeline execution logs display homework answers with distinctive formatting markers for easy identification. Additionally, the MLflow interface provides independent verification through the Artifacts section, where users can examine model files and metadata directly.

## Data Persistence Architecture

### Volume Mounting Strategy

The system implements strategic data persistence through carefully planned volume mounting that ensures durability while maintaining clean separation of concerns between different data types.

```
Host Directory Structure    Container Mount Points           Data Classification
├── data/postgres/         → PostgreSQL data volume        → Metadata persistence
├── data/mlflow-artifacts/ → MLflow artifact storage       → Model and experiment data
├── data/taxi-data/        → Dataset cache                 → Raw data persistence  
├── data/models/           → Local model storage           → Intermediate artifacts
└── data/pipeline-data/    → Prefect execution data        → Workflow metadata
```

This architecture ensures that experimental work survives container lifecycle events while providing clear organizational boundaries that facilitate maintenance and debugging procedures.

### Storage Durability Considerations

The volume mounting approach addresses several critical requirements in MLOps system design. Database persistence ensures that experimental metadata remains available across system restarts. Artifact storage durability enables model reproducibility and compliance auditing. Dataset caching reduces external dependency requirements and improves execution performance.

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Experimental Iteration Workflows

The MLflow integration enables sophisticated experiment comparison and model evolution tracking. Multiple pipeline executions automatically create versioned experiments that can be compared through the MLflow interface. Parameter modifications and their resulting performance changes become visible through the experiment tracking dashboard.

### Pipeline Customization Strategies

The modular architecture facilitates systematic experimentation with different configuration parameters. Dataset selection can be modified to process different time periods or taxi types. Model selection can be altered to explore alternative algorithms and their resulting artifact characteristics. Feature engineering logic can be enhanced to investigate different preprocessing approaches.

### System Observability Features

The integrated monitoring capabilities provide comprehensive visibility into system operation. Real-time execution tracking enables immediate identification of performance bottlenecks or failure conditions. Historical analysis through MLflow enables trend identification and system optimization opportunities. Resource utilization monitoring helps identify scaling requirements as workloads increase.

## Troubleshooting and Diagnostics

### Service Availability Issues

When deployments fail to appear in the Prefect interface, examine the flow server container logs to identify initialization problems. Service connectivity issues often manifest as empty deployment listings or failed flow registration messages.

```bash
docker compose logs prefect-worker
```

Successful initialization produces messages indicating proper flow serving configuration and deployment registration completion.

### Experiment Tracking Problems

MLflow interface issues typically relate to database connectivity or artifact storage access problems. Examine both the MLflow server logs and PostgreSQL container status to identify connection failures or permission issues.

```bash
docker compose logs mlflow
docker compose logs postgres
```

Database initialization messages should confirm successful table creation and service readiness.

### Pipeline Execution Failures

Flow run failures require detailed examination through the Prefect interface task logs. Common failure modes include network connectivity issues preventing external data access, insufficient resource allocation for large dataset processing, or volume mounting permission problems preventing file system access.

The Prefect dashboard provides hierarchical error information that enables systematic diagnosis from high-level flow status down to individual task failure details.

### Artifact Storage Diagnostics

Missing MLflow artifacts typically indicate volume mounting or permission configuration problems. Verify that the artifact storage directory exists and has appropriate write permissions for the container processes.

```bash
ls -la data/mlflow-artifacts/
docker compose logs mlflow | grep -i artifact
```

Successful artifact storage operations generate log messages confirming file creation and storage location updates.

## Technical Architecture Analysis
